# p5-sketchbook
My P5.js Sketchbook. Each sketch was created within 10 minutes and may be featured on my [blog](http://niklasbarning.de/).

You can either view the files in your browser or manage them with P5 Manager.
To view the sketches with P5-Manager, do the following:

```
$ npm install -g p5-manager
```
Navigate in the terminal to the folder with the sketches and run:

```
$ p5 server
```
